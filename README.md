# note-taker

## Description

### Problem: 

As a small business owner, it can be challenging to keep track of important tasks and thoughts. Jotting down notes on paper can be disorganized and easily lost. Without a reliable system in place, important information can slip through the cracks, resulting in missed opportunities and tasks left undone.

### Solution:

To solve the problem of disorganized thoughts and tasks for small business owners, I have developed a note-taking application that provides an efficient and reliable solution. Here's how I accomplished this:

1. Configured a landing page with a link to the notes page using HTML and CSS.
2. Built a functional notes page with existing notes displayed in the left-hand column and empty fields for new notes in the right-hand column using React.js.
3. Used React state management to handle user input and store new notes.
4. Implemented a save icon that appears in the navigation at the top of the page when a new note is entered, allowing users to save their notes to a JSON file.
5. Utilized React router to enable users to navigate between the landing page and notes page.
6. Tested the application using Jest and Enzyme to ensure that all features function correctly and that the user interface is intuitive and 
user-friendly. <br><br>
By following these steps, I was able to develop a note-taking application that provides small business owners with a simple, yet powerful way to organize their thoughts and tasks. This solution offers a reliable and efficient system for note-taking, allowing users to save, manage, and reference their notes with ease.
